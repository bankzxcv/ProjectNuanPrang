More than 1,000 tornadoes sprout up across the United States in the average year, causing billions of dollars in damage and killing ... The majority of the U.S. is prone to tornadoes. Some states have higher risks than others, why is this? Most tornadoes that form in the U.S. come from either a supercell, or a &quot;quasi-linear convective system&quot; (QLCS). Tornadoes are most common in supercells due to their isolated rotating updraft. Nearly 20% of all tornadoes are produced by a QLCS, but are typically weaker and short lived. To further explore these changes, we computed tornado-day trends during warm- versus cool-season as a function of U.S. states in tornado-prone regions (Fig. 3, S2c).Here, the warm season is ... Annually, the United States experiences about 1,248 tornadoes on average based on SPC data from 2003-2022. The catastrophic April 2011 Super Tornado Outbreak, during which over 360 tornadoes struck the Southeast, serves as a stark reminder of how devastating these natural events can be when numerous tornadoes occur in quick succession.\n",
